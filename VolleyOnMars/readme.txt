Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. 
In this project I am using volley to make webserivce request to flicker api to get an image corresponding to a querry. 
Application also makes a HTTP request to marsweather api build by NASA to get current weather information on mars.
The response received from api(s) is in json object form which is parsed to get the desired data.
